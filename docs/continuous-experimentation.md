# Continuous Experiment Design
## Hypothesis
Adding example feedbacks as placeholder text inside the review textbox, allows user to understand how to write feedback for restaruant, which will make the reviews more accurately predicted by the model.

## Experiment
The experiment we will do is have two version of our app. One with the placeholder text and one without. We will measure whether the model makes the correct prediction according to the user.

## What was changed
The change between the two version is whether there are placeholder text inside the review textbox.


## Metrics to measure 
User's feedback on whether the model make the correct prediction.
